  Hey Terrence! I honestly came into the term ready to not contact the advisor, but now I don't even know where the committee would be at without you. Thanks for being literally the best advisor on board (I've talked to people to confirm) and being so passionate about tech and peepo!!

  [JENNIFER: Hey Terrence! Thank you for being our advisor, I'm sure there's a lot we can learn from you. Please sprinkle us with your wisdom (and show us more pictures of your cat)!]

  [ALVIN: Hi Terrence!! It was nice meeting you at AX! I honestly was so shook when I found out you were also the District Tech Advisor LOL. I had no idea but small world huh? Hopefully you'll let me come back to volunteer next year!! Thanks for taking time out of your day to come to our meeting Sunday morning, I know it most be kinda annoying to wake up early just for some college kids xD Hope you're enjoying your job at Laserfiche!! Anyways we'll see you again maybe at our next in-person!! If not, I'll see you at AX 2020 ;) -Best, Alvin]

  [ALLISON:  Hi Terrence, thanks for answering all my questions even tho I can be wack sometimes and I’ll probably be asking a lot more questions, but in a year or like a few months, I’ll be stronger and more knowledgeable hopefully LOL]

  [MATTHEW: It was really nice meeting you Terrence! It was really cool getting to know you both on a professional level and on a personal one. It felt really easy to approach and talk to you since we have very similar interests both leisurely and professionally. I also really appreciate you clearing up some thoughts that I had personally. Thank you for being such a great advisor and support system for our committee!
  PS I will be bugging you a lot with stuff about the portal and in general so be prepared for that lmao]

  [RENZ: you have such a colorful personality that it feels like you’re more like a committee member and not necessarily our Kiwanis Advisor! I’m glad to have gotten to know you more as the summer has progressed; you’re always helpful and amazing at the tech work you’ve helped our committee accomplish so far! ]
