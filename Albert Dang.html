  Hey, it's nice to be able to work with you for another year! Hopefully with more time and more organization this term, you'll make a bomb mobile app. Sorry about the date of the first in-person, we'll try to bond more over the term lol.

  [RENZ: As quiet as you can be, I enjoy conversations with you! We missed you at the first in-person, but I know that we’ll have another chance to meet up and chill together. Maybe you can come through as a FBI milk man. (jk) I’m looking forward to what this term has coming up!]
