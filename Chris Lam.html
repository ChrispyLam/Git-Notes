  [RENZ: Howdy Chris! I remember first talking to you at FTC and remembering how informative you were about tech committee, and now we’re here! Talking to you more at our in-person shows how insightful & fun you are to talk to, even if it gets quiet. I’m looking forward to what our next in=person has in store, and many work-nights and memories ahead!]
