  Even though I watched you do your application, thanks for taking the time to join the committee along with having your duties as a president. There's definitely lots of uses for data, let's find some cool stuff to do for the District!

  [MATTHEW: It�s always so funny whenever we meet up. I would only usually only see you during a DCM or an interclub, but now I pretty much have to see you almost every week; it feels like I�m actually apart of LB lmao, but it�s always fun so there�s nothing to complain about, or maybe there is LMAOOOO]

  [RENZ: I think you put the “Stella” in interstellar! Like you space out sometimes and your personality is very bright and spectacular! And I’m excited that I get to join your club this upcoming fall and beyond; you’re going to be an amazing committee member and an even more dedicated president, Stella! I appreciate all that you do!]
