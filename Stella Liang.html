  [MATTHEW: It�s always so funny whenever we meet up. I would only usually only see you during a DCM or an interclub, but now I pretty much have to see you almost every week; it feels like I�m actually apart of LB lmao, but it�s always fun so there�s nothing to complain about, or maybe there is LMAOOOO]
