<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[JENNIFER: Hi Allison! Even though you're the youngest in the committee, I'm sure your talents will shine through! I can't wait to see your work on the committee and I hope we can get to know each other better.]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[STELLA: Hi Allison! It was nice to spend the weekend with you and get to know you more! Even though we didn't talk for too much, knowing a talent and reliable you on committee gives me faith that we as a whole can make a lot of great work done! Can't wait to see your great work!]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[TIFFANY: Hey Allison! I'm so glad we got to talk more and bond during the in-person! You're a super cool person and a great driver of a HYDROGEN FUEL CAR OO: Looking forward to working together and talking to you more this year!]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[RENZ: I am surprised that while we live in the same city, we only just now bonded so much in like, 3 days after having a whole term! For real, like I remember when Chris first made our group chat! I was like “Wait is this the same Allison from IVC?” LOL. But in any case, I enjoyed the fun car rides, your sense of humor, and our weekend with the committee! And I’m looking forward to more memories, work nights and beyond! (: Hopefully we’ll find time here and there to hang out too; I appreciate you!]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
