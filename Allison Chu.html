  Hey! It's crazy how you were the only 1st year on the committee. You're getting started really early (as VPA??), hopefully you'll be able to learn and explore a lot in tech this year!

  [JENNIFER: Hi Allison! Even though you're the youngest in the committee, I'm sure your talents will shine through! I can't wait to see your work on the committee and I hope we can get to know each other better.]

  [ALVIN: hey Allison!! it was nice getting to know you more at in-person HAHA I appreciate you driving but that meant we couldn't be in each other's cars xD anyways you're a super chill person and i'll probably see you again at another rave before I see you at an in-person HAHA ]

  [STELLA: Hi Allison! It was nice to spend the weekend with you and get to know you more! Even though we didn't talk for too much, knowing a talent and reliable you on committee gives me faith that we as a whole can make a lot of great work done! Can't wait to see your great work!]

  [TIFFANY: Hey Allison! I'm so glad we got to talk more and bond during the in-person! You're a super cool person and a great driver of a HYDROGEN FUEL CAR OO: Looking forward to working together and talking to you more this year!]

  [MATTHEW: It was really cool meeting you and your hydrogen car with its hydrogen bonds and stuff. Honestly I completely feel you with the summer classes and all of the comp sci stuff cause I’m over here dying for the same exact reasons so pretty much we’re in the same exact boat but hey I’m sure we’ll survive *big question mark?* LMAO. ]

  [RENZ: I am surprised that while we live in the same city, we only just now bonded so much in like, 3 days after having a whole term! For real, like I remember when Chris first made our group chat! I was like “Wait is this the same Allison from IVC?” LOL. But in any case, I enjoyed the fun car rides, your sense of humor, and our weekend with the committee! And I’m looking forward to more memories, work nights and beyond! (: Hopefully we’ll find time here and there to hang out too; I appreciate you!]   Hey, it's nice to be able to work with you for another year! Hopefully with more time and more organization this term, you'll make a bomb mobile app. Sorry about the date of the first in-person, we'll try to bond more over the term lol.
