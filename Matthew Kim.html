  Hey Matthew! Glad to have you on the committee. I remember meeting you at a DCM and all the questions you were asking about CS. I hope you're able to learn a lot this term, and thanks for always participating in meetings.

  [JENNIFER: Hey Matthew, thanks for staying up with me to make our pitiful curry rice during in-person. I still don't really know you that well, but you seem really cool. I can't wait to see your work in tech!]
