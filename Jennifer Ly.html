  [RENZ: I’m sorry I moved the window blinds open at “just the right angle” to let the light in the following morning LOL but that said, I enjoyed our in-person, but I wish I got to know you more! I know we'll have more chances for that in the future though, and I’m excited to see where things go for us on tech committee!]
